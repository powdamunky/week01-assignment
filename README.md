## Reflection

I believe I have completed the task, and all the stretch goals, but am very concerned that due to website optimisation and browser policies some elements will not load correctly, and I will in-turn fail this assignment. I have tested the audio multiple times, looked for workarounds, but fear I am not going to have time to complete my other task of the career plan if I try too hard to get the audio working. 
Having said that, the most difficult part for me has been the background images and trying to get the website to a point where it is readable. I really need to work on producing visually appealing websites, as everything I make right now looks like a Geocities nightmare. I also am kind of aware that my CSS is a mess, and I may tidy it up over the course of the final few hours before submission.
I was grateful to Joe for the resources he supplied as they helped greatly, and just talking to someone concerning my lack of confidence helped me to not feel so defeated at the start of the assignment process. I still feel like I am miles behind the rest of my peers on the course, partially due to my current mental and physical condition, and partially due to my lack of clear comprehension of some elements of web-design. I am going to stick with it though, and push myself to study more in my free time, and maybe even make some demo sites and code to hone my skills.
